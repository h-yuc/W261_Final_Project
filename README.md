## Question Formulation
Introduce the goal of your analysis. What questions will you seek to answer, why do people perform this kind of analysis on this kind of data? Preview what level of performance your model would need to achieve to be practically useful. 
## EDA & Discussion of Challenges 
Determine 2-3 relevant EDA tasks that will help you make decisions about how you implement the algorithm to be scalable. Discuss any challenges that you anticipate based on the EDA you perform.
## Feature Engineering
Apply relevant feature transformations, dimensionality reduction if needed, interaction terms, treatment of categorical variables, etc.. Justify your choices.
## Algorithm Exploration
Apply 2 to 3 algorithms to the training set, and discuss expectations, trade-offs, and results. Do not over fine tune these. You will want to use this process to select a final algorithm which you will spend your efforts on fine tuning.
## Algorithm Implementation
Create your own toy example that matches the dataset provided and use this toy example to explain the math behind the algorithm that you will perform. Apply your algorithm to the training dataset and evaluate your results on the test set. 
## Conclusions
report results and learnings for both the ML as well as the scalability.
## Application of Course Concepts
Pick 3-5 key course concepts and discuss how your work on this assignment illustrates an understanding of these concepts.
